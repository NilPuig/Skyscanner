# General:

### Q) How long did you spend on the test?

Around 5 days, devoting 2-3 hours each day.

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

I would try to make the scrolling more smooth.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

The overall final design.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

Fetching certain information using API

### Q) How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test or our API, we'd love to hear them.

I think it was much more interesting than the usual iOS tests, I like the idea of building something instead of just testing my knowledge.
